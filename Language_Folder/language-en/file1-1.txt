We don’t regularly think about the intricacies of our own languages. It’s an intuitive behavior used to convey information and meaning with semantic cues such as words, signs, or images. It’s been said that language is easier to learn and comes more naturally in adolescence because it’s a repeatable, trained behavior—much like walking. And language doesn’t follow a strict set of rules, with so many exceptions like “I before E except after C.” What comes naturally to humans, however, is exceedingly difficult for computers with the amount of unstructured data, lack of formal rules, and absence of real-world context or intent. That’s why machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are gaining attention and momentum, with greater human dependency on computing systems to communicate and perform tasks. And as AI and augmented analytics get more sophisticated, so will Natural Language Processing (NLP). While the terms AI and NLP might conjure images of futuristic robots, there are already basic examples of NLP at work in our daily lives. Here are a few prominent examples.
